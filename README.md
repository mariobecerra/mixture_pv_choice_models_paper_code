Code for paper *Bayesian D- and I-optimal designs for choice experiments involving mixtures and process variables* by [Mario Becerra](http://mariobecerra.github.io/) and [Peter Goos](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00006560). Paper can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950329323001222), and the PDF can be downloaded [here](https://mariobecerra.github.io/files/becerra_goos_2023_published_elsevier.pdf). The accepted manuscript can be found on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02604).

I also presented a talk on the topic, *Bayesian D- and I-optimal designs for choice experiments involving mixtures and process variables*, given at the International Choice Modelling Conference (ICMC) in Reykjavik, Iceland on May 25th, 2022. A video of it can be found [on Youtube]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1mTYUNu0A0&feature=youtu.be).

R package [opdesmixr](https://github.com/mariobecerra/opdesmixr) must be installed to run the code. Further instructions will be added to this README in the future.
